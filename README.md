### Overview

For my second project I chose to create an app that can be used by local amateur players to keep track of available playing times at local ice rinks. These available playing times are referred to as "sticktimes". 

The Sticktimes App allows a user to have favorite rinks and view the available stick times for each rink.

### Unsolved Problems

While the MVP of this project has been reached my goal is to have all routes fully built and working so that the app will be able to be used by actual players. 

The following list are some objectives that need to be completed for this.

* Finish POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for rinks and sticktimes
* Create a page for each user that displays all favorite rinks WITH sticktimes on a SINGLE page
* Complete CSS for all pages
